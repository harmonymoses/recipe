This project is a simple Student Grade Tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add students with their grades, display the list of students, calculate the average grade, and remove students when needed and uses JavaScript arrays and objects to store student data and updates the page dynamically using DOM manipulation.
